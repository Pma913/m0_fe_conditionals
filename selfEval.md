# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
   I feel fairly confident in the comparison operators. They are straight foreword and easy to understand.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
   Logical operators as well just made sense. There was a little grey area with those though and that was the "or" for me. Why is it that the "or" logs true insted of false if one of them is true? Couldn't it be either way really?
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
   I understand the if statements also. I would love to spend more time with them (and I am sure I will) to get deeper and more complex with them.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
   I spent entirely too much time on these! Not sure where it all went, and I am definitely still getting used to time management. If I had to do it over again, I'm sure I could easily cut the time in half.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
   I still need to manage time properly. I scoot out for lunch then before I know it I have spent half an hour eating, then I burn more time getting settled in again. Maybe I need to try to reach a certain checkpoint in my project before I break for lunch.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
   My question is will I hit my stride with my time management. I assume I will get them my adjusting my calander and trying again.
